# Color_Is_Good
A "Falling Game" made on processing. 

### Personal Note
This game was a demonstration of my learning progress on Java. This game demontrates a multitude of mechanics and programming concepts - 
  * Object Oriented Programming
  * Class based Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
  
  to name a few.

I also concerend myself with **scope** although that is irrelevant to Processing - It made sure the skills I acquired from this were directly transferable. I paid close attention to the structure and readability of the code making sure to divide relevant sections of the code; Comment code Appropriately and Order the code segments to make sense in the order they are read.

### About the Game

The game has a simple concept. 

The player can move left and right along 5 lanes. 

Mobs; Bounties; And power Ups spawn and go up the screen. 

Mobs can be of multiple colors. 

The **Game Statement** is visible at the bottom and changes randomly - In the format *Color* is *good/Bad*

That logic dictates what mobs are interactable and what should be avoided.

#### Features
* Multiple Types of Mobs with Multiple Colors.
* Dynamic Game Logic
* Random Tile Generation
* Optimised Asset loading with a MediaHandler Class
* Bounties and Extra Lives.
